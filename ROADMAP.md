## üéØ Next Immediate Tasks

1. **Set up GitHub Actions CI** (Priority: High)
   - Basic build and test workflow
   - Multi-platform testing
   - Release automation

2. **Add Core Unit Tests** (Priority: High)
   - Test coverage > 80%
   - Mock GitHub API responses
   - Test error scenarios

3. **Implement Linting** (Priority: Medium)
   - golangci-lint configuration
   - Pre-commit hooks
   - CI integration

4. **Fix Known Issues** (Priority: High)
   - Repository-scoped cache (currently mixing repos)
   - Progress display for actual fetch counts
   - Proper handling of large repositories

5. **Documentation** (Priority: Medium)
   - API documentation
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Contributing guidelines

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Cache Scoping**: Currently, the cache mixes data from different repositories
   - Need to add repository column to all tables
   - Or use separate databases per repository

2. **Progress Tracking**: The spinner shows "0 fetching" instead of actual counts
   - Need to pass progress updates from GitHub client to UI

3. **Large Repository Handling**: Timeouts occur with very large repositories
   - Need better pagination handling
   - Consider GraphQL API for efficiency

4. **Error Recovery**: No resume capability for interrupted fetches
   - Should track fetch progress in database
   - Allow resuming from last successful page

## üìä Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Fetch 1000 PRs in < 2 minutes
- **Reliability**: 99.9% success rate for API calls
- **Usability**: < 5 seconds to start analyzing any repo
- **Quality**: > 80% test coverage, A+ on code quality tools

## üóìÔ∏è Timeline

- **Q1 2025**: Complete Phase 4-5 (Testing & CI/CD)
- **Q2 2025**: Complete Phase 6-7 (Advanced Features & Performance)
- **Q3 2025**: Complete Phase 8-9 (Enterprise & Analysis)
- **Q4 2025**: Complete Phase 10 (Developer Experience)

## üí° Future Ideas

- Web UI for visual analysis
- Real-time PR monitoring
- Slack/Discord notifications
- AI-powered PR insights
- Integration with other tools (Jira, Linear, etc.)
- Mobile app for PR reviews
